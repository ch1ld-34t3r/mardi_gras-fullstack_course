          <p>Mardi Gras in New Orleans</p>
          <p>
            The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in southern Louisiana,
            including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for
            about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before
            Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian
            tradition). Mardi Gras is French for Fat Tuesday, but the season
            actually begins on King’s Day (12th Night), January 6th, and extends
            until midnight before Ash Wednesday. Club, or Krewe, balls start
            soon after, though most are extremely private, with their Kings and
            Queens coming from wealthy old families and their courts consisting
            of the season’s debutantes. Most of the high society Krewes do not
            stage parades. As Fat Tuesday gets nearer, the parades start in
            earnest. Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
            permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and
            most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
            Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New
            Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls
            (some of them masquerade balls).
          </p>
          <p>
            The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as
            krewes; most follow the same parade schedule and route each year.
            The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
            earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus.
            Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large
            parades and events (often featuring celebrity guests), such as the
            Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social
            Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float
            riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common
            throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated
            plastic "throw cups", and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes
            follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

          <p>Toyota Cantrell, Mayor of New Orleans</p>
          <p>
            As Mayor of the great City of New Orleans, I invite you to visit our
            city to experience the excitement of Mardi Gras!
          </p>
          <p>
            The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the
            Feast of the Epiphany, also called Twelfth Night or Kings’ Day.
            Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling
            before Mardi Gras Day. Our private Carnival clubs, called krewes,
            take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade
            goers. Visitors quickly learn to say, "Throw me something mister!"
          </p>
          <p>
            The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi
            Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club and the Rex
            Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate
            costumes add to the fun-filled day of excitement for revelers of all
            ages.
          </p>
          <p>
            New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and
            cuisine, is an exciting place to be at any time of the year. We
            invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their
            lifetime. Make your plans now to be a part of this great tradition
            and see firsthand why we say, "Laissez les bon temps rouler!"
          </p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
          <p>LaToya Cantrell</p>
